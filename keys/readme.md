# DataProtection Key Directory
This file is a placeholder to create a shared directory for DataProtection keys.

In a real life deployment you'd place the keys far outside of your development root, and never check any files in this directory into source control. 
You'd also protect them with DPAPI or an X509Certificate.

Please see the [Data Protection documentation](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/security/data-protection/index.html) for how to configure Data Protection.
